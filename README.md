# Arduino-Classes-2019/20-First-Workshop

# Introduction 
Hey guys! Welcome to UoSM Robotics Club's First Workshop! If you have any questions please ask!

# There are 3 main folders here, Mini_Piano, POV (Persistence of Vision), Scale and Wave!
1. Folder Mini_Piano contains code using capacitive touch to play sound, creating a mini piano!
2. Folder POV contains two types of Persistence of Vision.
3. Folder Scale plays some tones from lowest frequency to the highest and back down to the lowest!
4. Folder Wave illuminate LED in a waveform pattern!
5. We have also included a powerpoint in case you need some reference :smile:
